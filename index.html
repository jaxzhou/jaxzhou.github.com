              <H5>MAGIC CUBE</H5>
                Magic Cube is an iOS game designed by 徐赫 and developed by me. It's a game with grid of cubes. Each cube has a color and a shape.
                Select one cube, accord to the shape different cubes in the grid will be actived. After that you can only choose the same color cube that was actived.
                The selected cubes would be connected one by one. While the connections become a closed ring. All cubes in the ring or on the connection would be destroyed.
                While cube destroyed, you get score.
